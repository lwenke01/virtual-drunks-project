## Project proposals

1. On the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor with the following information:

 - Drink With A Cold One
 - Lisa, Joe, Kyle, Marshall
 - Create a virtual drinking game High & Low with dead famous people as they insult you. This also tracks how many drinks you intake  and factors that in to how the game goes. More drinks = blurred images, more smack talk, etc.
 - A diagram of relevant details from your project's domain model (See java_framework.md)
 - A few wireframe sketches of your project's pages (see wireframes folder)
